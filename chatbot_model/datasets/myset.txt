bubble sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high. Code Link: https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bubble-sort

tell me about binary heap
It’s a complete tree All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible. This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

merge sort
The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

quick sort
Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

heap sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

iterative heap sort
HeapSort is a comparison based sorting technique where we first build Max Heap and then swaps the root element with last element (size times) and maintains the heap property each time to finally make it sorted. Code: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-heap-sort

what is dsa?
The term DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. As the name itself suggests, it is a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – Data Structure and Algorithms. Read More: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/#whatIsAlgo
